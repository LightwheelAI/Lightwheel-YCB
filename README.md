# Lightwheel-YCB

Lightwheel-YCB is a high-quality simulation asset benchmark built upon the [YCB Benchmarks](http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/) - Object and Model Set. It features 125 meticulously crafted simulation-ready assets across three categories: Deformable, Articulated, and Rigid. Each asset is available in both MJCF and USD formats, ensuring compatibility with popular simulation frameworks.

## üéØ Mission

Lightwheel-YCB aims to provide the embodied AI community with an easily accessible simulation asset benchmark, enabling researchers to:

- Build realistic simulation scenes using top-quality SimReady assets
- Design complex tasks based on accurate physics interactions
- Develop robust simulation frameworks
- Test sim-to-real transfer capabilities (all assets are digital twins of real YCB objects)
- Establish standardized benchmarks for evaluating AI models across simulation and real-world environments
